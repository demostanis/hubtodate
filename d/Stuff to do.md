Stuff to do
===========

Whetever features be missing or bugs waiting to be fixed, they will be listed here. There are also, at some places in the code, comments starting with "TODO:".

Create a website
----------------

This is not high priority as this is still beta software, but making a (static?) website hosted on GitHub pages would be great.

Write tests
-----------

For now, the only testing way is using Docker, and checking if it works. Having tests would make the test surface bigger. (not only with pre-defined rules)
