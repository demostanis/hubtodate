      <h1 id="Creating_your_own_rules"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">Creating your own rules</a></h1>
<p>A rule doesn&#39;t yet exist for a repository? You can easily create your own. They are simple INI files with more functionality.</p>
<p>They can take any file extension, except <code>.ex</code> or <code>.example</code>, which are ignored by HubToDate, and are usually stored in <code>/usr/share/hubtodate/rules</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Structure"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">Structure</a></h2>
<p>Rules work like INI files, meaning their structure should be of multiple key value pairs, down a header:</p>
<pre class="pod-block-code">[header]
key = value</pre>
<p>The four possible headers for a rule are <samp>repository</samp>, for any information related to the repository to install, such as the owner and name, <samp>release</samp>, which describes how to find, unpack and install a release, <samp>verification</samp>, which tells how to verify the downloaded archive with GPG or by checking sums, and optionally <samp>options</samp>, to change HubToDate&#39;s behavior per rule.</p>
<p>The value may be multiline, by specifying a backslash at the end of the line:</p>
<pre class="pod-block-code">[header]
key = multiline \
        value
otherkey = ...</pre>
<p>The equal sign may also be replaced by a colon, meaning that: <code>key : value</code> works as well.</p>
<h2 id="Types"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">Types</a></h2>
<p>Each value has a type, either string (by default), integer, true, false, or nothing.</p>
<p>In case the value is only made of numbers, (e.g. 42) its type will be integer. If it contains a non-numeric character, its type will be string. (e.g. 42s)</p>
<p>In case the value is positive, such as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;true&quot; (&quot;yep&quot; and &quot;yeah&quot; might also work), its type will be true. As opposite, negative values such as &quot;no&quot; or &quot;false&quot; (or &quot;nope&quot;, &quot;Nah&quot;, &quot;0&quot;) will be of type false.</p>
<p>Last but not least, three dots (&quot;...&quot;) will specify type nothing, meaning it has no value. You can also simply not write the key value pair.</p>
<h2 id="Comments"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">Comments</a></h2>
<p>Lines starting by a hashtag (&quot;#&quot;) or a semicolon (&quot;;&quot;) will be understood as comments and ignored. Same applies to comments after a value:</p>
<pre class="pod-block-code"># This is a comment
key = value ; This is ignored!</pre>
